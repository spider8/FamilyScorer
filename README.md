# FamilyRank

FamilyRank aims to generate a list of people eligible to win a government public house, with the only requirement that this list is ordered as fairly as possible with a sum of points, analyzing aspects of the families that are participating.

To achieve an easy-to-maintain architecture, I chose to decouple the family ranking algorithm, thus greatly facilitating the addition of new criteria.

This project uses TDD as a development method and SOLID.
